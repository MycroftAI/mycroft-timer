## About 
Use Mycroft when your hands are messy or you need more that the one timer in your kitchen.  Multiple timers are easy to set and track with conversational interactions.

On a Mark 1 you'll see visual feedback as the timer runs, and you can use
the top button to stop the beeping once a timer expires.

## Examples 
* "Start a timer for 30 seconds"
* "Set a timer for 1 minute"
* "Set a timer for 3 hours called turkey"
* "Start a timer" (will be prompted)
* "Cancel the timer"
* "How long is left on the timer?"
* "How long is left on the turkey timer?"
* "Mute the timer" (once triggered)
